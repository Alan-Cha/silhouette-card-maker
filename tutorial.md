# Custom Cards with a Cameo Cutting Machine

<!-- !TODO: YouTube video -->

![](images/display.jpg)

Making your own custom card games is fun and rewarding!

You can play with your favorite artwork! You can create your own designs! You can easily replace lost or damaged cards!

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to make cards with a cutting machine, specifically the Silhouette Cameo 5.

<!-- !TODO: Cameo 5 picture -->

Why use a cutting machine though?

The alternative is to use a craft knife, a rotary cutter, or a paper guillotine and to do it all by hand. You can try your best but you're only human... Your cuts won't be exactly the same. Some cards will be too tall, too fat, slightly twisted, off center, or some combination of the above. Plus, you're body will be sore after the whole ordeal.

Join me in the 21st century where we have technology to solve our problems!

With the press of a button, a cutting machine can do all the hard work for you. Before cutting, it scans the page to calibrate itself, so each card comes out exactly the same, with rounded corners, perfectly sized, perfectly centered, the platonic ideal of a playing card.

## Disclaimer

In this tutorial, I'll show you how I make cards with laminated card stock. I think they are great because they are durable, shuffle smoothly, are dry erase, and require no sleeves.

However, maybe you already have a workflow you like! This tutorial still has value for you.

If you do any kind of manual cutting in your existing workflow, you can replace it with a cutting machine. For example, a common way to make custom cards is to slide a paper cutout in front of a sleeved, dummy card. Another way is to cut out a sticker to apply to a sacrificial card. Any of these methods can be improved by using a cutting machine.

<!-- !TODO: Picture of alternative ways making cards -->

The goal here is not necessarily to convince you to follow my process, but rather to empower you so you can use a cutting machine to make cards with whatever method you want.

## Costs

Let's run the numbers.

Each sheet produces 8 cards and each sheet is composed of:
* a sheet of card stock, $10 for 150 sheets
* a lamination pouch, $20 for 200 pouches
* printer ink, $1 double-sided color printing

($10/150 sheets + $20/200 pouches) / 8 cards = $0.02 per card without printing

($10/150 sheets + $20/200 pouches + $1 printing) / 8 cards = $0.15 per card with double-sided printing

You could make a deck of 100 custom cards for around $15!

Sure, there may be a significant upfront cost to get started but you can quickly recoup the cost, especially if you're already accustomed to ordering custom cards online, paying for shipping, and sleeving up cards.

These businesses and they charge as much as $2 per card and $0.75 cents per card for bulk orders. That's a farcry from $0.15 per card!

The most expensive purchase you'll likely make is the cutting machine, which can cost $300.

However, if you were considering ordering custom cards but decided to make them instead, you could recoup the cost of the printer in as few as 165 cards and as many as 500 cards, given the aforementioned pricing. To some, that may sound like a lot of cards, but to others, that's negligible.

And if you're already a card-making aficionado, perhaps you wouldn't save much monetarily but if you're doing the work manually, you'd save time and wear on your body if you used a cutting machine. Perhaps, that's worth it in and of itself.

## Bill of Materials

*Disclosure: There are affiliate links below, meaning I may receive a small commission if you click through and make a purchase at no extra cost to you. I will only recommend products that I have tried and paid for myself and enjoyed using.*

Equipment
* [Cutting machine (Cameo 5)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-5?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) (Silhouette store coupon code: `DIYBOARDGAMES`)
* [Thermal laminator](https://amzn.to/3E82k57)
* Inkjet printer
* [Printer cable (USB 2.0)](https://amzn.to/4jeHsrI)
* Computer

I recommend the Cameo 5 because it's the cutting machine I use. However, if the cost is too high, you can consider purchasing the previous generation, the 4. The [4 Plus]( https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-plus?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) is still available on the official website and is significantly cheaper than the 5. Another affordable choice is the [Portrait 4]( https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/portrait-4?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link), but I think the versatility of the 4's dual tool carriage and wide cutting area outweighs the slightly cheaper price of the Portrait 4. Please note that these other machines may use different cutting blades and cutting mats. 

I recommend this laminator for a number of reason. First, it's not particularly expensive compared to others. Second, most laminators support only one or two hot settings (3 and 5 mil). This is the only reasonably priced laminator I've found with 4 hot settings: 3, 4, 5, and 6 mil. Because laminators are built for printer paper and not card stock, it's helpful to have these additional settings to ensure lamination quality. Lastly, this laminator is wide, which makes it easy to feed sheets and finish cards.

I do not have a recommendation for printers. However, if you plan on purchasing a printer, consider purchasing an inkjet printer instead of a laser printer. The laser toner affects the lamination, causing it to easily detach. It's possible to use a laser printer but you'll have to be gentle. Also consider purchasing a duplex printer. It's possible to use a simplex printer but you may not have good front and back alignment. Lastly, I think this is a good place to splurge on. First, you want to enjoy the cards, so if you're using a subpar printer, you may eventually regret it. Second, poor print quality can affect the Cameo's registration.

There's nothing special about this printer cable but it's cheap and it's also a two pack! The Cameo 5 does not come with a cable because it supports Bluetooth. However, the Bluetooth connection is spotty so I recommend interfacing directly with a cable.

Materials
* Printer ink
* [Card stock (110 lb)](https://amzn.to/3RuU4PA)
* [Thermal lamination pouches (3 mil)](https://amzn.to/3E5yE8M)

The card stock I use is 110 lb but it may be too thick for some printers. Please refer to your printer's manual. If 110 lb is too thick, 60 lb also works well. I've also heard amazing things about double-sided glossy photo card stock, but it only works with dye-based inkjet printers, so I will not recommend it. Regardless, any decent card stock will work.

Similarly, any decent lamination pouches will work. I've also heard good things about matte lamination pouches but they are not as common and also more expensive.

Optional
* [Extra cutting mats (12 x 12 in)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cut-mat-12-3t-c?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link)
* [Extra cutting blades (AutoBlade)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/silh-blade-auto-2?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link)
* [Hobby knife with cutting mat](https://amzn.to/41UT2CF)

You'll want to pick up extra cutting mats. Cutting mats are sticky and they hold the sheet as its being cut. Over time, they'll lose their stickiness and must be replaced. Additionally, it's nice to have extra mats so you can prep one as another one is being cut. Each mat should last for a few hundred cards or a few dozen sheets as long as you take care of them.

The Cameo 5 can cut a lot of materials including tough materials like corrugated paper, chipboard, and wood. However, if you're only cutting cards, your blade should last a long time. At the same time, if you're new to these machines, you could accidentally break the blade due to improper set up. Consider buying an extra as a back up.

A hobby knife and a (non-sticky) cutting mat can come in handy. Occasionally, the Cameo will leave you a straggler card where it's not completely detached. You can use the hobby knife to finish the cut.

## Primer on Cameo Cutting Machines

The Cameo is core to this process so it's important to give some background so you'll be better prepared to operate one.

### Silhouette Cameo 5

The Cameo 5 is an electronically operated cutting machine. It's similar to a laser cutter or a CNC machine. A computer controls the movement of the toolhead, which contains a small blade similar to a hobby knife, and the toolhead will cut the material. You can control various cutting parameters including the speed of the blade and the pressure of the blade, and you can cut various materials including paper, card stock, sticker paper, cardboard, vinyl, foam, fabric, and even leather. You can also purchase special add-on tools for foiling, embossing, and other purposes.

<!-- !TODO: diagram of Cameo 5 -->

Additionally, the Cameo 5 supports Print & Cut. Print & Cut means the machine scans your printed page and automatically adjusts itself so that it's able to cut precisely and consistently every time. You do not have to worry about aligning the sheets as the machine will make adjustments as needed. As long as the sheet is generally in the right area, the machine can compensate for placement and tilt. This is pivotal for card games because you want the backs of every card to be indistinguishable. More on Print & Cut later.

You only need to use a few buttons to operate a Cameo 5. First, there is the power button, which is on the right side of the machine. Second, there are the media load and media eject buttons on the bottom of the control panel. The buttons are used load and eject the cutting mat that carries your sheet. Lastly, there's a repeat cutting job button that appears on the top of the control panel.

<!-- !TODO: diagram of Cameo 5 control panel -->

### Silhouette Studio

Silhouette Studio is the software used to create cutting designs and control the Cameo 5. It is easy to use and has simple visual UI. You can create a cutting template by drawing shapes on then screen and when you are ready, the machine will cut those shapes out. You can do fancier things like import an image (with a transparent background) and the software can cut out its outline, which is great for stickers and collages. However, I've included cutting templates in this tutorial so you won't need to make your own unless you're interested in making cards in a special size or shape.

<!-- !TODO: screenshot of Silhouette Studio -->

As mentioned before, an important aspect of this process is Print & Cut. You need to enable it in a cutting template in order to reap the benefits. When you enable Print & Cut, Silhouette Studio will do two things, it'll add registration marks to your cutting template, and when you print, it'll have the machine scan for registration marks before cutting. The registration marks are what the cutting machine uses to determine the orientation of your paper and make the proper adjustments when cutting. However, the templates in this tutorial already have Print & Cut enabled so you will not need to change anything.

<!-- !TODO: screenshot of Silhouette Studio with Print & Cut -->

## Prerequisites

### Printer alignment

If you plan on having card backs and/or if you plan on making double faced cards, then you need to ensure that printer can print with good front and back alignment. Otherwise, your card fronts and backs may have an offset.

Your printer may have built-in tools for calibration and alignment adjustment. However, if you do not have access to your printer's settings, I have provided a CLI tool that can add an offset to every other page in a provided PDF. You can use this offset to compensate to offset that your printer naturally provides. To learn more, see [here](README.md#offset_pdfpy).

### Cutting settings

Silhouette Studio provides a number of cutting settings, including blade pressure, cutting speed, passes, and blade depth.

<!-- !TODO: screenshot of Silhouette Studio cutting settings -->

Before starting the tutorial, determine the cutting settings that works best for you and the materials you want to cut.

Unfortunately, there are no short cuts for this. You will need to do some experimentation on your own.

I recommend creating a simple cutting template with Silhouette Studio. Set the blade pressure, cutting speed, and blade depth to something reasonable, but set passes to 1. You can have the machine recut again and again to determine the required passes. Prepare your cutting material, stick the material onto the cutting mat, insert the mat into the machine, and start the cutting job. Try different combinations of settings and repeat as necessary.

<!-- !TODO: screenshot of a simple cutting template -->

The following is a table of working settings from various testers. Do not use these settings blindly. Test conservatively and work up to the listed values. If not, you risk breaking your machine or cutting through your mat.

| Machine | Blade          | Card stock     | Lamination  | Pressure | Speed | Passes | Depth |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Cameo 5 | Autoblade      | 65 lb          | 3 mil       | 30       | 30    | 3      | 7     |
| Cameo 5 | Autoblade      | 110 lb         | 3 mil       | 33       | 20    | 3      | 7     |
| Cameo 5 | Autoblade      | 110 lb/199 gsm | 3 mil       | 33       | 30    | 4      | 10    |
| Cameo 5 | Autoblade      | 220 gsm        | 150 microns | 30       | 26    | 4      | 8     |
| Cameo 3 | Deep-Cut Blade | 110 lb         | 3 mil       | 33       | 5     | 5      | 19    |

---

### Upgrade pip (Python's package manager)
```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Create the virtual environment:
```shell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

**Terminal (macOS/Linux):**
```shell
. venv/bin/activate
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> [!TIP] If you get a security error when activating in PowerShell, run:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
> ```

---

### Install Python packages
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Create the PDF

First, put all your card front images into `game/front`. Then, put a card back image into `game/back`.

> [!NOTE]
> My friend, Jon Lenchner, has offered his card game, Zero sumZ, as an example for this tutorial. Zero sumZ is a abstract pattern-matching game and you can find the game assets [here](examples/ZERO%20SUMZ/). These game assets are for educational purposes only.

Generate the PDF with the following:

```shell
python create_pdf.py
```

You can find the PDF in `game/output/game.pdf`.

<!-- > [!TIP]
> `create_pdf.py` offers many options such as configuring paper and card size, supporting double-sided cards, and adding registration marks to the front sides. To learn more, see [here](README.md#cli-options). -->

---

### Prepare the sheets

Print out the PDF and laminate the sheets.

> [!TIP]
> Because cardstock is thicker than normal printer paper, you may need to set your laminator at a higher setting in order to get good lamination. If not, you may have cloudy lamination and delamination issues.

---

### Cut the sheets

Open the `letter_standard_<version>.studio3` cutting template in Silhouette Studio. Cutting templates can be found in the [`cutting_templates`](cutting_templates/) directory.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> The cutting template you should use depends on your PDF generation options. -->

Put a laminated sheet on the cutting mat. The side with the registration marks, the black square and "L"s, should face up. Orient the sheet so that the black square is in the top left corner. Apply the laminated sheet onto the mat such that the top left corner of the card stock, not the lamination, is aligned with the top left corner of the grid on the mat.

![Sheet alignment](images/sheet_alignment.jpg)

Insert the mat into the machine. The left edge of the mat should be aligned with the notch on the machine. Then, click the media load button on the machine.

![Mat alignment](images/mat_alignment.jpg)

Finally, start the cutting job. The machine should begin the Print & Cut process and cut out the cards.

> * [Why did my cards come out diagonally?](#why-did-my-cards-come-out-diagonally) -->

---

### Finish the cards

Click the media eject button on the machine to remove the mat. Peel off the cards and excess.

Because the cutting process may cause the card edges to delaminate, put the cards through the laminator a second time.

Now you're ready to play with your cards!

## Next Steps



## FAQ

### Do I need to laminate my cards?

No. Lamination provides a lot of advantages like durability, water resistance, shuffleability, and card feel, but it's not necessary. However, if you're planning on using a cutting machine to help with another workflow that doesn't require lamination, you don't need to do so.

### How do laminated cards compared to mass produced cards?

It depends on the weight of your card stock and the thickness of your lamination, but from personal experience with 110 lb card stock and 3 mil lamination, I think it's very similar to mass produced cards.

If I had to say anything, I would say this combination is only marginally thicker than mass produced card but if you plan on using card sleeves and playing with a mix of both, I would say it's almost indistinguishable.

### Can I make double-sided cards?

Yes. The `create_pdf.py` script has many other features including laying out double-sided cards. To see the full documentation, please see [here](README.md#double-sided-cards).

Long story short, put the fronts in `game/front` and the backs in `game/double_sided`. The names of the files must match for each pair. Then, simply run `create_pdf.py` as usual.

### Do you have printer recommendations?

No, but I can give you give you some ideas on what you should look for.

First, I do not recommend getting a laser printer. The laser toner affects the lamination, causing it to easily delaminate. It can work, but you may have issues with delamination during cutting and while removing cards from the cutting mat.

Secondly, determine what kind of custom cards you'd like to make. Do you want to make double-sided laminated cardstock cards like mine? Perhaps single sided is suitable for your situation? Perhaps you'd like to cut out regular printer paper or sticker paper and use an alternative way of making custom cards.

Not all printers can handle card stock, and even if it can handle card stock, it may not be able to handle thicker card stock like 110 lb. Additionally, if you plan on making double-sided cards, getting a printer that can do duplex printing would be ideal. If you have a simplex printer, you can feed the printed pages back into printer to achieve double-sided printing, but you could have issues with alignment.

Invest in a good printer because you want the cards to look nice as you play with them and because poor quality printing can also affect the Cameo's Print & Play.

### Why are my card delaminating?

Are you using a laser printer? The laser toner sticks to the lamination, which prevents the lamination from sticking to the paper. Laser printing can work with this process, but you'll have to be gentler with the cards while cutting and while playing.

Try laminating a second time or laminating at a higher setting before cutting. Because card stock is thicker than printer paper, you need to use more heat to get proper lamination. Additionally, this will help to clear up any cloudiness in your lamination, making your cards look better in the end.

### Why are my cards wavy?

Set your laminator to a lower setting. It's adding too much heat, causing the lamination to contract more than needed.

Alternatively, immediately put the laminated sheets under a heavy book to let them cool down flat.

### Why is the registration failing?

Ensure that there is nothing blocking the registration sensor.

Ensure that the sheets are generated with the right template and printed with 100% scale.

Ensure the sheet is placed correctly on the mat and the mat is placed correctly in the machine. Otherwise, the machine can struggle to scan the registration marks. The top left corner of the paper, not the lamination, should align with the top left corner of the grid on the mat. The left edge of the mat should align with the notch on the machine.

Try playing around with the lighting. If the room is too bright or too dark, the machine may have issues. Try shining a light at the sensor to provide more lighting. Try closing the cover as well.

In my own experience, the registration can occasionally fail as the machine is scanning the bottom left L. This occurs when the machine unintentionally scans the bottom left card as it's searching for the bottom left L. If you have this issue, try covering the bottom left card with a Post-It note during registration and removing it before cutting.

![Registration fix](images/registration_fix.jpg)

If none of the previous tips worked, the issue may be your choice of paper, lamination, or printing.

### Why didn't my machine cut all the way through?

Did you configure your cutting settings? The cutting templates do not contain cutting settings. You must add your settings manually. To learn more, see [here](#cutting-settings). 

If you configured you cutting settings, then try adjusting your settings by adding more pressure or more passes. If you are still having issues, try using a new blade and/or mat.

### Why is my machine cutting in the wrong place?

Make sure you're using the right cutting template. Each sheet should be labeled with the cutting template it's associated with, for example "letter_bridge_v1".

### Why did my cards come out diagonally?

As mentioned in [Why is the registration failing?](#why-is-the-registration-failing), your machine may occasionally scan the bottom left card as it's searching for the bottom left L during registration. When this happens, the machine may either stop and complain, or continue and start cutting cards diagonally. To fix this, try being more careful when you place the sheet and the mat, or employ the Post-It note trick.

### Why are my cards offset?

If either the fronts or the backs are offset, then there's most likely an issue with your printer alignment. Refer to your printer's instruction manual and try to recalibrate it. If there's no way to change the printer's settings, try using [offset.py](README.md#offset_pdfpy) to compensate for the offset.

If both the fronts and backs are offset, then there may be an issue with registraion. Ensure that you are printing with the right scale and cutting with the right cutting template, and ensure that there's nothing that can interfere with the registration process.
