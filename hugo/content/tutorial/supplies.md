## Equipment

* [Cutting machine (Cameo 5)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-5?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) (coupon code: `DIYBOARDGAMES`) / [Amazon alternative](https://amzn.to/3Sua8le)
* [Thermal laminator](https://amzn.to/3E82k57)
* Inkjet printer
* [Printer cable (USB 2.0)](https://amzn.to/4jeHsrI)
* Computer

I recommend the Cameo 5 because it's the cutting machine I use. However, if the cost is too high, you can consider purchasing the previous generation, the 4. The [4 Plus]( https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-plus?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) is still available on the official website and is significantly cheaper than the 5. Another affordable choice is the [Portrait 4]( https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/portrait-4?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link), but I think the versatility of the 4's dual tool carriage and wide cutting area outweighs the slightly cheaper price of the Portrait 4. Please note that these other machines may use different cutting blades and cutting mats.

I recommend this laminator for a number of reason. First, it's not particularly expensive compared to others. Second, most laminators support only one or two hot settings (3 and 5 mil). This is the only reasonably priced laminator I've found with 4 hot settings: 3, 4, 5, and 6 mil. Because laminators are built for printer paper and not card stock, it's helpful to have these additional settings to ensure lamination quality. Lastly, this laminator is wide, which makes it easy to feed sheets and finish cards.

If you plan on purchasing a printer, consider purchasing an inkjet printer instead of a laser printer. The laser toner affects the lamination, causing it to easily detach. It's possible to use a laser printer but you'll have to be gentle. Also consider purchasing a duplex printer. It's possible to use a simplex printer but you may not have good front and back alignment. Lastly, I think this is a good place to splurge on. First, you want to enjoy the cards, so if you're using a subpar printer, you may eventually regret it. Second, poor print quality can affect the Cameo's registration.

There's nothing special about this printer cable but it's cheap and it's also a two pack! The Cameo 5 does not come with a cable because it supports Bluetooth. However, the Bluetooth connection is spotty so I recommend interfacing directly with a cable.

## Materials

* Printer ink
* [Card stock (110 lb)](https://amzn.to/3RuU4PA)
* [Thermal lamination pouches (3 mil)](https://amzn.to/3E5yE8M)

The card stock I use is 110 lb but it may be too thick for some printers. Please refer to your printer's manual. If 110 lb is too thick, 60 lb also works well. I've also heard amazing things about double-sided glossy photo card stock, but it only works with dye-based inkjet printers, so I will not recommend it. Regardless, any decent card stock will work.

Similarly, any decent lamination pouches will work. I've also heard good things about matte lamination pouches but they are not as common and also more expensive.

Optional
* [Extra cutting mats (12 x 12 in)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cut-mat-12-3t-c?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) (coupon code: `DIYBOARDGAMES`) / [Amazon alternative](https://amzn.to/3GKwigs)
* [Extra cutting blades (AutoBlade)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/silh-blade-auto-2?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) (coupon code: `DIYBOARDGAMES`) / [Amazon alternative](https://amzn.to/3GMN8eM)
* [Hobby knife with cutting mat](https://amzn.to/41UT2CF)

You'll want to pick up extra cutting mats. Cutting mats are sticky and they hold the sheet as its being cut. Over time, they'll lose their stickiness and must be replaced. Additionally, it's nice to have extra mats so you can prep one as another one is being cut. Each mat should last for a few hundred cards or a few dozen sheets as long as you take care of them.

The Cameo 5 can cut a lot of materials including tough materials like corrugated paper, chipboard, and wood. However, if you're only cutting cards, your blade should last a long time. At the same time, if you're new to these machines, you could accidentally break the blade due to improper set up. Consider buying an extra as a back up.

A hobby knife and a (non-sticky) cutting mat can come in handy. Occasionally, the Cameo will leave you a straggler card where it's not completely detached. You can use the hobby knife to finish the cut.
