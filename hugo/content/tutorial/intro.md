Making your own custom card games is fun and rewarding!

You can play with your favorite artwork! You can create your own designs! You can easily replace lost or damaged cards!

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to make cards with a cutting machine, specifically the Silhouette Cameo 5.

Why use a cutting machine though?

The alternative is to use a craft knife, a rotary cutter, or a paper guillotine and to do it all by hand. You can try your best but you're only human... Your cuts won't be exactly the same. Some cards will be too tall, too fat, slightly twisted, off center, or some combination of the above. Plus, you're body will be sore after the whole ordeal.

Join me in the 21st century where we have technology to solve our problems!

With the press of a button, a cutting machine can do all the hard work for you. Before cutting, it scans the page to calibrate itself, so each card comes out exactly the same, with rounded corners, perfectly sized, perfectly centered, the platonic ideal of a playing card.

## Disclaimer

In this tutorial, I'll show you how I make cards with laminated card stock. I think they are great because they are durable, shuffle smoothly, are dry erase, and require no sleeves.

However, maybe you already have a workflow you like! This tutorial still has value for you.

If you do any kind of manual cutting in your existing workflow, you can replace it with a cutting machine. For example, a common way to make custom cards is to slide a paper cutout in front of a sleeved, dummy card. Another way is to cut out a sticker to apply to a sacrificial card. Any of these methods can be improved by using a cutting machine.

The goal here is not necessarily to convince you to follow my process, but rather to empower you so you can use a cutting machine to make cards with whatever method you want.
